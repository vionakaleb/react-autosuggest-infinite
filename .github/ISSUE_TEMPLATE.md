## Are you reporting a bug?

* Please create a Codepen that demonstrates your issue. You can start from the [Basic example](http://codepen.io/moroshko/pen/LGNJMy).

* Provide the steps to reproduce the issue, e.g.:
  1. Focus on the input field
  2. Type `c`, and wait for suggestions to appear
  3. Press <kbd>Escape</kbd>

  **Observed behaviour:** Suggestions stay open

  **Expected behaviour:** Suggestions should be closed

## Are you making a feature request?

* Please describe your use case from user journey point of view, e.g.:

  > In my application, when user highlights suggestions (using the mouse or keyboard), I'd like to display additional information about the highlighted suggestion alongside the Autosuggest.

* If you have ideas how to extend the Autosuggest API to support your new feature, please share!

* If you know any examples online that already implement such functionality, please share a link.
